# Mac OS & MS fonts in ttf

> All the fonts you need.
-- _[potyt](https://github.com/potyt)_

These are Mac, Microsoft & other fonts from [potyt/fonts](https://github.com/potyt/fonts) (including `.dfont` file format) all converted to `.ttf` file format.
The `.dfont` files have been converted thanks to the [fondu](http://fondu.sourceforge.net/) project.

On most Linux systems, you can copy the directory to ~/.local/share/fonts, where fontconfig will find them.
